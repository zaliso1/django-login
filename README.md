# django-login
A simple django project that allows for people to create accounts and make schedules. 

In order to use you must have python installed (the latest version is available <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>). 
Once that is installed you need django as well so write in your terminal python -m pip install django. 
In order to run the web server you must make your directory the mysite folder and type python manage.py runserver in your terminal.
